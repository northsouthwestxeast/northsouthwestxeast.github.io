How big the brain is — within it holds the sky, the sea, language and me.

During my undergraduate study, linguistics taught me how from sound comes syllable and from scribble comes script. Now working in the lab, neurolinguistics grants me the opportunity to navigate through the organ that makes it all happen. 

I have since embarked on a journey, from east to south, west, and north, searching answers for questions like: From _language_ to _語言_, what happen when we add new sets of language to the brain? And why does it come with ease in some but not others? Functional and diffusion MRI techniques are my great companions in this journey.

Beside language, my brain also holds music, origami, digital cat (only one allergy away from dropping the "digital"), and trip planning to see more skies and seas.
